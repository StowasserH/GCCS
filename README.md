Basic GemCraft Scripts
========

These scripts for the python-based hotkey extension "Autokey" help to play [Gemcraft 2: Chasing Shadows](http://gameinabottle.com/) to win the game.


### Prepare:

You need https://github.com/autokey/autokey to use this script.
You also need to have "xte" installed on your system.

#### Supported operative systems:

Since AutoKey and xte currently only run on Linux, this script only works on it.
The actual GCCS game can be played on Steam using the Proton 6.3-8 compatibility tool.
